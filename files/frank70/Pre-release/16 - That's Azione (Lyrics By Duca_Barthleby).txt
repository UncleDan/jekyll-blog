(In Hattrick where random is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When the random hits you eye like a big colpo di testa
That's azione
When the server seems to shine when you're winning 7 on 1
That's randomme
Can you say "tromba-tromba-la" "tromba-tromba-la"
And you will banned for spam
Matches will play on the Saturday, on the saturday
It's a game full of gays

When the stars make you drool perché ne fai più di Marrund
That's skilltrading
When tifosi dance down the streets with a cloud at their feet
You're in love
When you walk down in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming promozione
Scuzza me, but you see, I'm living in Hattrick
That's amore

When the random hits you eye like a big colpo di testa
That's azione
When the server seems to shine when you're winning 7 on 1
That's randomme
Can you say "tromba-tromba-la" "tromba-tromba-la"
And you will banned for spam
Matches will play on the Saturday, on the saturday
It's a game full of gays

When the stars make you drool perché ne fai più di Marrund
That's skilltrading
When tifosi dance down the streets with a cloud at their feet
You're in love
When you walk down in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming promozione
Scuzza me, but you see, I'm living in Hattrick
That's amore
Lucky fella

When the stars make you drool perché ne fai più di Marrund
That's skilltrading
When tifosi dance down the streets with a cloud at their feet
You're in love
When you walk down in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming promozione
Scuzza me, but you see, I'm living in Hattrick
That's amore, (amore)
That's amore

Title: That's Amore

When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta fazool
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk down in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming signore
Scuzza me, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore
